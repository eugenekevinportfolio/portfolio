I stayed in Tokyo in a sharehouse with many strangers from different countries, while I was doing an internship in UI-UX at Locarise, in Shinjuku. Living in Tokyo was probably one of the best experiences I have ever had, a journey I truly cannot forget and that will stay with me forever. I met so many inspiring people, with their own dreams and aspirations. They taught me so much and also introduced me to new ways of thinking that opened up my mind and creativity.

    paragraph: "The Golden Week is a week of holidays in Japan in April where people travel the most, mostly thanks to the cool weather at that time of the year. I decided to place most of my free days around it so I could have longer holidays and travel in Southern Japan, Kyushu. It was truly the pinnacle of my stay in Japan, and probably of my entire life up until now: it was a time of complete freedom and endless discovery in a marvelous culture I embraced so passionately.
